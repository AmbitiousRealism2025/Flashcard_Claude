      title: 'ChatGPT Basics',
      question: 'What is ChatGPT and what can it do?',
      explanation: 'ChatGPT is a conversational AI that can answer questions, write content, help with coding, brainstorm ideas, and assist with various tasks. It understands context and can have natural conversations while helping you solve problems or learn new topics.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-2',
      title: 'AI Image Generation',
      question: 'How do AI image generators like DALL-E and Midjourney work?',
      explanation: 'AI image generators use machine learning models trained on millions of images to create new pictures from text descriptions. You simply describe what you want to see, and the AI interprets your words to generate unique images that match your description.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-3',
      title: 'Prompt Engineering',
      question: 'What is prompt engineering and why is it important?',
      explanation: 'Prompt engineering is the art of crafting effective instructions for AI tools. Good prompts are clear, specific, and provide context. They help you get better results by telling the AI exactly what you want, how you want it formatted, and what style or tone to use.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-4',
      title: 'AI Writing Assistants',
      question: 'How can AI writing tools like Grammarly AI or Jasper help with content creation?',
      explanation: 'AI writing assistants can help brainstorm ideas, improve grammar and style, generate drafts, create outlines, and adapt content for different audiences. They serve as collaborative writing partners that can speed up the writing process and improve quality.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-5',
      title: 'Voice AI Assistants',
      question: 'What are the main capabilities of voice AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant?',
      explanation: 'Voice AI assistants can understand spoken commands, answer questions, control smart devices, set reminders, play music, provide weather updates, and perform web searches. They use natural language processing to understand what you say and respond appropriately.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-6',
      title: 'AI Code Assistants',
      question: 'How do AI coding tools like GitHub Copilot help programmers?',
      explanation: 'AI code assistants can suggest code completions, explain existing code, help debug errors, generate functions from comments, and translate code between programming languages. They act like a pair programming partner that understands coding patterns and best practices.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-7',
      title: 'Machine Learning vs AI',
      question: 'What\'s the difference between AI and Machine Learning?',
      explanation: 'AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the broader concept of machines performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on systems that learn and improve from data without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-8',
      title: 'AI Translation Tools',
      question: 'How accurate are AI translation tools like Google Translate or DeepL?',
      explanation: 'Modern AI translation tools are highly accurate for common language pairs and can handle context much better than older systems. They work best with clear, standard text but may struggle with idioms, cultural references, or highly technical content. They\'re excellent for getting the general meaning of text.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-9',
      title: 'AI Ethics and Bias',
      question: 'Why is it important to understand AI bias and ethical considerations?',
      explanation: 'AI systems learn from human-created data, which can contain biases and prejudices. Understanding these limitations helps you use AI tools more responsibly, fact-check important information, and recognize when AI might not be giving you complete or unbiased answers.'
    },
    {
      id: 'card-10',
      title: 'Getting Started with AI',
      question: 'What\'s the best way for a beginner to start using AI tools?',
      explanation: 'Start with user-friendly tools like ChatGPT or Claude for conversations and questions. Experiment with image generators for creative projects. Practice writing clear, specific prompts. Start with simple tasks and gradually work up to more complex projects as you learn how each tool works best.'
